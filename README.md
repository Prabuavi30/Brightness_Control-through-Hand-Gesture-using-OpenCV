**How It Works**
The application captures webcam frames.

MediaPipe identifies hand landmarks.

It calculates the Euclidean distance between the thumb and index finger.

Based on this distance, the screen brightness is increased or decreased proportionally.

python main_inti.py
Once running:

->Show your hand to the webcam.

->Pinch your thumb and index finger to adjust the brightness.

->Use the GUI buttons to start/stop the webcam.
